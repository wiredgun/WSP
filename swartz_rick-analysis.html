                </div>
                
                <p>The purpose of redesigning glucalite.com is to structure the site to better reach the broad spectrum of English-speaking people around the world that suffer with blood sugar issues. It is believed by eliminating the superfluous sales-oriented content, and replacing it with educationally oriented content will lead to in enhanced credibility and as a consequence improved marketability.</p>
                <p>By focusing on a high-frequency rotation of more meaningful content will also allow the site to benefit from Google Caffeine, and other algorithmic changes to their search engine.</p>

                <p>Competition in this market is steeped with inferior players, and therefore we have recommended that GlucALite® reposition itself as the leader in quality, value, and service rather than another low-priced player in the market.</p>

Today, elevated blood sugar and diabetes have become a major health concerns for the Chinese in direct correlation with the proliferation of dining establishments such as McDonald’s, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Wendy’s to name a few. As a result of this corporate expansion and the export of western lifestyles, diabetes has become a global epidemic.</p>
